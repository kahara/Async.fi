      <description>This was long overdue but I&amp;rsquo;ve finally switched to a modern static site generator. The old system was written by myself in Python 2 many moons ago, and adding posts consisted of writing plain HTML into a monolithic XML source file, then deploying to S3 where Cloudfront served it from. Porting the Python 2 code to Python 3 would&amp;rsquo;ve likely been tedious, and would&amp;rsquo;ve still left me stuck with HTML.</description>
