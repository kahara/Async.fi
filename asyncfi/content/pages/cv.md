## Profile

Joni is a programmer and general "DevOps" person from Helsinki, Finland.
He has worked in the technology industry since 1997.

Some of the things that bring him joy in the professional context include:

* Remote work. Open, preferably asynchronous, text-based communication.
* Automating things that can be automated. Think Ansible, Terraform, and Kubernetes.
  And GitHub and GitLab workflows.
* Enabling domain specialists to write testable sets of microservices that can be deployed
  with least effort, and changes of which can be managed controllably.
* Working with services on "edge", or in other words things that interface with the real world.
  Also anything with tight latency requirements.
* Writing readable, robust, and performant code (and tests) in Go or Python that doesn't
  waste resources. Rust and C have their special time and place, too.
* Writing readable documentation (Markdown, Pandoc preferred). Also technical writing in general,
  and reading anything that is well-written. Well thought out diagrams always a huge plus.
