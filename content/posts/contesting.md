Recently, I accidentally ended participating in a
[amateur radio contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contesting).
I was checking in
[pskreporter.info](https://pskreporter.info/)
how things looked like on
[6-meter band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-meter_band),
and noticed that there was an unusual amount of local (to Finland) FT8 activity
going on. Intrigued, I set the station up in the balcony and tried to get into
the action. Which didn't work out right away because, although I noticed that
the traffic didn't look normal, it took a while to understand that what was
going on was
["EU VHF Contest"](https://oh6zz.com/2022/6m/6m_10_2022.txt).
After some fiddling with
[WSJT-X](https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/k1jt/wsjtx.html)
settings, I was able to get the correct contest mode on and I was in.

This was exciting! Although my location
([KP20le](https://k7fry.com/grid/?qth=KP20le))
is in the middle of an urban setting and I have a vertical against what are
mostly horizontal antennas, and I can only get around ten watts into that
antenna, I was able to make some QSOs. Not that
many or that far away, but still, usually the 6-meter band is quite silent
(from my point of view at least) but now there were many stations on air.

Today was another _second Thursday of month_ and I participated from the start,
making
[about the same amount of contacts](https://oh6zz.com/2022/6m/6m_11_2022.txt)
as last time.

Here are the stations I was able to hear:

And who heard me:

For next months contest, I'm planning to go to the
[most prominent peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malminkartanonhuippu)
we have around here and work with a portable dipole. This should (in theory)
improve the results significantly. But let's see&mdash;
