## Profile

Joni (b. 1975) is a programmer, machinist, and dilettante from Helsinki, Finland.
He has worked in the technology industry since 1997.

Some of the things that bring him joy in the professional context include, in no
particular order:

* Remote work. Open, preferably asynchronous, text-based communication. Lack
  of hierarchy.
* Automating things that can be automated. Think Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes,
  and Helm and Flux. And GitHub and GitLab workflows.
* Keeping things observable with the likes of Prometheus, Alertmanager, and
  Grafana.
* Troubleshooting weird and complex situations, especially ones revolving around
  networking.
* Working with people possessing a built-in, _sufficiently paranoid_ approach
  towards cybersecurity.
* Working with services on "edge", or in other words things that interface
  with the physical world. Also anything with tight latency requirements.
* Writing readable, robust, and performant code (including tests) in Go or Python
  that doesn't waste resources. Rust and C have their special time and place,
  too.
* ^That being said, sometimes a quick hack with no polish is _good enough_.
* Working with domain specialists.
* Writing readable documentation (Markdown, Pandoc preferred). Also technical
  writing in general, and reading anything well-written. Properly thought out
  diagrams always a huge plus.
